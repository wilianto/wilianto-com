## Hi, I'm Wili!
I'm a sofware engineer from Indonesia. Currently I'm working as software engineer at [KMKLabs](http://kmklabs.com). Develop software in an Agile way, using Extreme Programming methodologies (pair programming, test driven development, continuous integration, and continuous deployment)

## What I'm doing now
- Working fulltime at KMKLabs
- Trading bitcoin everyday
- Learning Golang and Hadoop
- Interested in building aquascape together with my brother

## What I'm familiar with
I used to work with LAMP stack with some popular framework such as **Laravel**, **Yii** and **CodeIgniter**. But currenty I work with **Ruby on Rails** with **Postgres**, **Redis**, **Memcache** and **Varnish**.

When working at KMKLabs, TDD is very important, so it means now I always write my test first before the implementation.  I usually write my test using **RSpec**, **Jasmine** and **Selenium**.
